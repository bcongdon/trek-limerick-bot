## Configuration

1. Copy the `.env` template

    ```
    cp .env.template .env
    ```

2. [Create](https://apps.twitter.com/) a Twitter app and note your credentials.
3. Use the credentials from the last step to fill in the following fields in  `.env`:
    * `CONSUMER_KEY`
    * `CONSUMER_SECRET`
    * `ACCESS_TOKEN`
    * `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`

## Creating Rhyme Database

1. Create a set of parsed Star Trek scripts using [tng-parser](https://github.com/bcongdon/Scripts/tree/master/tng-parser).
2. Place this set of parsed scripts in a new `scripts/` directory.
3. Run `./trek-limerick-bot.js process`, and the scripts will be converted and placed into `processed/`,
4. Now you can run the `generate` and `post` commands, and `trek-limerick-bot.js` will use the processed scripts.
